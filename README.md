# Burger Best

This application logs a user's burger creation into a database and displays the creation one side of the screen. Next to each creation is a button that say "Devour it!" When the user clicks the button, that burger moves to the other side of the screen. Once the burger has been "devoured," another button appears next to that burger which says "Order Again!" Click that button will move the burger back to the other side and once again display the devour button next to it. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data into the app. Handlebars generates the HTML.
